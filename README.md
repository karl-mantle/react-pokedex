I will write a proper README when I have completed more of this app, or more accurately, when I have something worth writing about!

In short, it fetches data about a Pokémon from the PokéAPI and displays it. You can learn more about that here: https://pokeapi.co/

You can scroll through pages of Pokémon and click on one or search for a Pokémon by number or name.

For example, you can find Pikachu either by searching for his name or "25".

Then you get a pop-up listing various details about the Pokémon you've selected.

I got the idea from this project: https://github.com/axelfrache/PokemonFinder
